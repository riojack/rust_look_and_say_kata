## Look and Say Kata

This repository hosts my Rust solution for the [Look and Say Sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look-and-say_sequence).  From the Wikipedia article:
>To generate a member of the sequence from the previous member, read off the digits of the previous member, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit.

#### How to run the tests in this kata

1. Install Rust on your machine, from here: [rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).  This will also install a command line tool called 'cargo'.
2. `cd` into this repository and run `cargo build` then `cargo test`.

Note that this code was built on a MacBook Pro.  I have not tested this on Linux or Windows.
